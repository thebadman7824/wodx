## Dark Ages: Mage, casting (Ch. 4, pp. 97–105)

- **A spell** is first imagined, then checked against the caster's fellowship's beliefs: an effect outside what that
  school teaches cannot be cast at all, whatever the dots (p. 98).
- **Foundation and Pillars.** Each fellowship has one Foundation (how it works magic) and four Pillars (what it can
  do). A spell must fall within one or more of the caster's Pillars, at the level the effect needs (p. 98).
- **Simple spell** (one Pillar): roll Foundation + that Pillar; difficulty 4 + the Pillar level the effect needs
  (not the caster's rating). One success is the base (p. 98, summary box p. 99).
- **Complex spell** (two or more Pillars): roll Foundation + the highest Pillar involved + 1 die per other Pillar;
  difficulty 5 + the highest level needed + 1 per other Pillar (p. 98–99).
- **Difficulty above 9** stays 9; each point over adds one success needed. Lowering a difficulty first removes
  those extra successes, then lowers it from 9 (pp. 98–99).
- **Quintessence.** If any Pillar used is rated above the caster's Foundation, one Quintessence must be spent to
  steady the spell. Extra Quintessence lowers the difficulty 1 per point, at most 3, to a floor of 4; more than two
  points in a turn needs the Fount Background (pp. 99–100, Fount pp. 86–87).
- **Failure** (no successes, no 1s): no effect; casting the same spell again in the scene is +1 difficulty per
  earlier failure. **Short of successes with one or more 1s**: Backlash, and +2 per earlier failed or botched try in
  the scene (p. 100).
- **Extended spell**: successes add up roll by roll at intervals the Storyteller sets; a botch causes Backlash and
  loses everything gathered; a plain failure adds nothing that interval. Quintessence spent lowers only that roll
  (pp. 100–101).
- **Ongoing (lasting) spell**: an extended spell needing ten times the successes, 1 Quintessence per success, then
  sealed with 5 Quintessence per level of the highest Pillar and 1 Willpower per 10 Quintessence of that seal
  (rounded up) (p. 101). Cancelling one's own lasting spell costs 1 Quintessence per 10 spent on it (p. 104).
- **Foci.** Every Pillar needs its focus until Foundation 2; from then the mage may drop one Pillar's focus per
  Foundation dot after the first (WoDX reading of p. 102: at Foundation 2 one Pillar's focus may be dropped). Using a
  focus that is no longer needed gives -1 difficulty (floor 4) or replaces the Quintessence a too-high Pillar would
  need; once per spell. Spells learned from another fellowship always need their foci (pp. 101–102).
- **Belief.** A spell that works within a place's own superstitions cancels one 1 on the roll (p. 103).
- **Duration by successes** (normal / hurried): 1 turn / 1 turn; scene / 3 turns; day / 5; month / 10; six months /
  20; 6+ Storyteller / +20 turns per success over five (p. 103). Hurried spells take effect the turn after, except
  instant ones (p. 103).
- **Distance by successes** (normal / hurried): self or 20 ft / 3 ft; 100 yd / 20 ft; 10 mi / 100 ft; 500 mi /
  200 yd; across Christendom / 1 mi; then Storyteller / ×5 per success over five (p. 105). One extra success per
  extra target (p. 105).
- **Resisting.** Physical spells can be dodged (Dexterity + Dodge 6, each success removes one of the spell's) if the
  target is aware; mind-binding spells are resisted with Willpower (a roll, and 1 Willpower spent); a mage senses a
  spell coming with Perception + Awareness 8. Physical damage soaks normally; harm to spirit or mind does not (pp.
  104–105).
- **Cancelling** one's own spell: a turn, or one die from the pool if acting too (p. 104).

  sample rotes (Ahl-i-Batin, Messianic Voices, Old Faith, Order of Hermes, Spirit-Talkers, Valdaermen; hedge magic);
  Backlash, Branding and Scourging (pp. 136–143).

- The inner voice for mages (the Avatar): what DA:Mage calls the mage's inner spark and its pressures (Backlash,
  hubris), and M20's Avatar, Seekings and Quiet (pp. 44–46, 267, 339–340, 368–371, 240–243).
